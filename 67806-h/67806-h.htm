</div>


<p>I have borrowed from Mr. Paul
Heyse’s drama, <i>Maria von Magdala</i>, the
idea of two situations in my play, namely,
at the end of the first act, the intervention
of Christ, who stops the crowd raging
against Mary Magdalene with these
words, spoken behind the scenes: “He
that is without sin among you, let him cast
the first stone;” and, in the third, the
dilemma in which the great sinner finds
herself, of saving or destroying the Son of
God, according as she consents or refuses
to give herself to a Roman.</p>

<p>Before setting to work, I asked the venerable
German poet, whom I hold in the
highest esteem, for his permission to develop
those two situations, which, so to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
speak, were merely sketched in his play,
with its incomparably richer plot than
mine; and I offered to recognize his rights
in whatever manner he thought proper.
My respectful request was answered with a
refusal, none too courteous, I regret to
say, and almost threatening.</p>

<p>From that moment, I was bound to consider
that the words from the Gospel,
quoted above, are common property; and
that the dilemma of which I speak is one
of those which occur pretty frequently in
dramatic literature. It seemed to me the
more lawful to make use of it inasmuch
as I had happened to imagine it in the
fourth act of <i>Joyzelle</i>, in the same year in
which <i>Maria von Magdala</i> was published
and before I was able to become acquainted
with that play.</p>

<p>I will add that, excepting the principle
of these two situations, in all that concerns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
the subject of the play, the conduct of the
action, the persons, the characters, the evolution
and the atmosphere, our two works
have absolutely nothing in common: not a
phrase, not a cue of the one will be found
in the other.</p>

<p>Having said this, I am happy to express
to the aged master my gratitude for an intellectual
benefit which is none the less
great for being involuntary.</p>

<p>Here is the terrace, the glory of my little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
domain: it reminds me of my terrace at
Præneste, which was the crown of my desires.
Here are my orange-trees, my cypresses
and my oleanders. Here is the fish-pond,
the portico with the images of the
gods: one of them is a statue of Minerva,
discovered at Antioch. (<i>Pointing to the
landscape on the left.</i>) And here you
have the incomparable view over the valley,
where spring already reigns. We
hang midway in space. Admire the anemones
streaming down the slopes of Bethany.
It is as though the earth were ablaze
beneath the olive-trees. Here I relish in
peace the advantages of old age, which
knows how to take pleasure in the past;
for youth narrows the enjoyment of good
things, by considering only those which
are present....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>At last! Here are trees and water and
grass!... I had lost the memory of
them since my arrival in this stony desert
which men call Judæa.... But how
comes it, O my good master, that you have
taken up your abode near that dull and
barren city, where the soil is abominable,
where the men are ugly, churlish, crafty
and mischievous, unclean and barbarous?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>As you know, I came with the Procurator
Valerius Gratus to Cæsarea; then
I returned to Rome, where you were
for some time my faithful and favourite
pupil. But soon I became ashamed of
teaching a wisdom whose certainties became
more doubtful to my mind as the
assurance wherewith I proclaimed them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
increased. I was brought back here, to
this barbarous Judæa, by the strangest
curiosity. During my first sojourn, I had
begun to study the sacred books of the
Jews. They are crude and bloodthirsty;
but they also contain beautiful myths and
the early efforts of an uncivilized but, at
times, singular wisdom. They have not
yet wearied me.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Yes, our friend Appius, whom I met at
Antioch, told me of your studies and of
your sudden and inordinate passion for
old Jewish books....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>He will be here shortly....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Who? Appius?... Is he at Jerusalem?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>Did you not know?... But how
long have you yourself been in this country?...
In your letter of two days
since, you did not tell me....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Nearly a week; and I wished to give
my first leisure to you. I left Antioch
to go to Jerusalem with the Procurator
Pontius Pilate. He fears disturbances and
will probably need the help of my old
legionaries....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>The spacious, ample Appius, whose
words are as rambling as his habits and
bring together the most distant friends,
spoke to me of you, even as he spoke to
you of me. He told me that, when he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
the good fortune to meet you at Antioch,
you seemed a prey to some great unhappy
love....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Which was that?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>What! Can the handsomest of military
tribunes, in his magnificent array, know
more than one love that is not happy?...
It concerned a woman of these
regions, a Galilean, if I be not mistaken....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Mary of Magdala?... Did he
speak to you of her?... Where is
she?... I did not see her again; she
left Antioch suddenly; and I lost trace of
her....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>But why did she not listen to you?...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
Appius declared to me that she sets the
men of this country, it is true, at naught,
but shows herself not at all inexorable to
the Roman knights....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>It is one of those riddles of womankind
which our duties as soldiers hardly leave
us time to solve. She did not appear to
dislike me; at least, the dislike which she
affected was not without a harsh gentleness....
But there was mingled with
it a certain incomprehensible dread, which
made her timidly avoid me.... Besides,
she seemed lately to have suffered a
great sorrow, for which she has already, I
hear, consoled herself more than once....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>I do not know; and all this does not seem
to me so very discouraging. After all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
why afflict one’s self with what the gods
created for pleasure?... Appius,
therefore, wished me to cure you, by
my wise counsels, of an ill that saddens
you needlessly. But, first, do you love her
as much as Appius declares? His talk is
often extravagant and heedless....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>I desired her, I still desire her, as I
have never desired any woman....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>You speak wisely in not separating,
from the outset, desire and love. Besides,
I understand. She is certainly the loveliest
of all the many women whom I have
admired in my life.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>What!... You have seen her?...
Is she at Jerusalem then?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>She is even nearer to us than Jerusalem,
which is fifteen stadia from Bethany....
(<i>Drawing him a little to the right</i>). Come
to this portico and look over there, at the
bottom of the valley.... What do you
see?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>I see olive-trees, paths, tombs....
Then I see the pediments of palaces or
temples, columns, cypresses.... One
might think one’s self in the outskirts of
Rome.... But I do not perceive....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>It was Herod the Great, a sort of raving
lunatic, but given to building, who
filled this valley with splendid palaces
more Roman than those of Rome herself....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
But look half-way down the hill,
to the left of those three tall cypresses,
three or four stadia from here.... Do
you espy one of the most beautiful marble
villas?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>The villa with the wide white steps leading
to a semicircular colonnade adorned
with statues?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>That is where she has retired....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Mary Magdalene?... In that solitude,
so far from the city?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>She told me that she was fleeing from
the fanaticism of the Jews, the tumult and
the sickening smells, which increase twofold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
at Jerusalem as the Passover approaches....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Then you see her?... You have
spoken to her?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>The good Appius, knowing that the
sight of a young and beautiful woman delights
my eyes without endangering them,
did not dissuade her from coming up to
the house of a disarmed and harmless old
man....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>What did she say to you?... What
impression did she make upon you?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>She was clad in a raiment that seemed
woven of pearls and dew, in a cloak of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
Tyrian purple with sapphire ornaments,
and decked with jewels that rendered a
little heavier this eastern pomp. As for
her hair, surely, unloosed, it would cover
the surface of that porphyry vase with an
impenetrable veil of gold....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>I speak of her intelligence, her character....
Do not mistake: she is no
vulgar courtezan.... She has other
attractions, binding love more firmly....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>I minded only her beauty, which is real
and contents the eye.... However,
we can judge better presently: she will
soon be coming....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>She is coming here?... But does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
she know that she will find me with
you?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>Most certainly. It seemed to me that
this meeting would do more to assuage
your malady than the wise counsels threatened
by Appius....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>But she?... What did she say
when she learnt that....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>She smiled with a quivering and pensive
grace.... The other guests will be
our indispensable Appius and Cœlius, your
fellow-pupil at Præneste.... I hope
that they will bring our poor friend Longinus,
who, three weeks ago, lost a little
daughter two years old.... I will
try to console him, by good and persuasive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
arguments, for a sorrow certainly disproportionate
to his loss. We shall have,
among other dishes&mdash;all excellent, I
hope,&mdash;two fish from the Jordan, new to
you, which, dressed by Davus, my old
cook.... But I hear the sound of the
double flute.... It must be the litter
of the queen of Bethany and Jerusalem at
the threshold of my house.... Your
eyes will soon behold the soft light which
they have missed and mine the smile that
pleases them ... unless the silver mirrors
in the Atrium delay her longer than
they should....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Do not speak to me of my sacred books.
I loathe them, as I loathe everything that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>Pity me, instead of praising me. I was
robbed, last night, of my Carthaginian rubies,
besides twelve of my finest pearls;
and, what I feel even more, my Babylonian
peacock and all the murænæ in my fish-pond....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Who dared commit such manifest sacrilege?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>I do not know.... I have had the
slaves in charge of the aviary and the fish-pond
beaten with rods and put to the torture:
they have confessed nothing and I
believe that they know nothing....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Have you no clue, no suspicion?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>The theft amazes me, for the country
is safe.... I have been living here
for nigh six years; and no one has
ever tried to rob me of an atom of my
wisdom, which is never under lock and
key and is the only precious thing that
I possess.... The Jew is crafty,
sly and evil-minded; he practises cheating
and usury as well as most of the cringing
virtues and vices; but he nearly always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
avoids frank, straightforward theft, honest
theft, if one may say so....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>I at first suspected some Tyrian workmen
who are fitting one of the rooms in
my villa with those movable panels which
are changed at every course, so that the
walls may harmonize with the dishes covering
the table....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>I have seen some like them in the house
of our Governor, Pomponius Flaccus, at
Antioch; but I did not know that this
fashion, so new to Rome herself, had already
made its way into this remote
country....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>Nor will you find it, except in my house;
and the last palace of the Tetrarch Antipas
is still without it.... Therefore I began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
by suspecting those workmen; but I
have proofs that they are innocent. I now
feel sure that the thieves must be sought
among that band of vagrants and prowlers
who have been infesting the country
for some time....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>The famous band of the Nazarene....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>Even so. Their leader, I hear, is a sort
of unwashed brigand who entices the
crowds with a rude kind of sorcery and,
on the pretence of preaching some new law
or doctrine, lives by plunder and surrounds
himself with fellows capable of everything....
Besides, I have other causes
to complain of them.... Two days
ago, when I was walking in my gardens,
under the portico that divides them from
the road, a dozen wretches, belonging to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
that band, insulted me foully and threatened
me with stones.... It is becoming
intolerable; and it is time that the
countryside were rid of them....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>I have heard about those people....
I know that the authorities have their eyes
upon them.... I will have them
watched more closely. For that matter,
if you wish, it would be easy for me to
arrest their leader....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>Do so, I pray you, and as soon as possible....
I should be especially grateful
to you....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>I believe that you are misled. The robbers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
in my opinion, must not be looked
for there. I am in a fairly good position
to know the band, seeing that, for five or
six days, it has been gathered near my
house. I have even had the pleasure&mdash;for
everything turns to pleasure at my age&mdash;I
have even had the pleasure of attending
one of their meetings. It was near the old
road to Jericho. The leader was speaking
in the midst of a crowd covered with dust
and rags, among whom I observed a large
number of rather repulsive cripples and
sick. They seem extremely ignorant and
exalted. They are poor and dirty, but I
believe them to be harmless and incapable
of stealing more than a cup of water or
an ear of wheat.... They were listening
greedily to a more or less silly anecdote,
the story of a son who returns to his
father after squandering his patrimony....
I did not hear the end, for they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
looked upon me with a certain suspicion....
But the Galilean, or the Nazarene,
as they call him here, is rather curious;
and his voice is of a penetrating and peculiar
sweetness.... He appears to be
the son of a carpenter.... I will tell
you more of him, I know many interesting
things about him; but permit me first to
go to the other side of the house, which
commands the road, to see if my belated
guests are not in sight....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>There is no more best or worst love for

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>That I sell myself more skilfully and

<p>Magdalene!... You slander yourself!...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>You would see, if your desire prompted

I rate myself very highly.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>You will always rate yourself less highly

against pain....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

But, to return to less dazzling images,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
better-suited to my head burdened with
years, I observed that it must have been a
sort of presentiment that urged us to speak,
but a moment ago, of the Nazarene’s band,
for it was that same band which delayed
our guests....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>Yes, imagine, when we approached the
last cross-road down there, we found the
whole country in a stir and the way blocked
by a shouting, gesticulating throng, which
was crowding round a blind man who
saw!...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Yes, that is one of those phenomena
which one meets with nowhere except in
Judæa....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Cœlius</span></p>

<p>It was extraordinary!... The poor
man, crushed against an old wall, rolled
two drunk and virgin eyes, crying, “He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
is a prophet! He is a prophet! I see
men as trees, walking!” And the crowd
stamped all around for joy. He seemed
dazed with the light....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>Or rather with wine, for he was plainly
staggering.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>And the Nazarene, did you see
him?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>No, he had just gone away, taking with
him the most turbulent part of the crowd;
but for that, we should never have been
able to pass....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>Yes, it appears that, when those ruffians
crowd round their leader, they would not
trouble to make way for Cæsar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Cœlius</span></p>

<p>Where did he go?... I should be

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>He cannot be very far.... Do you
see that laurel-hedge, at the bottom of my
garden?... It divides my little domain
from the orchard of my neighbour,
known as Simon the Leper....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span> (<i>starting</i>)</p>

<p>What, your next neighbour is a
leper?... You should have told
us....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>Be reassured, lady, he has no leprosy
now....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>I thought that one became a leper for
life, just as one becomes a senator....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
This is another of the surprises of this
monstrous Judæa....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>The Nazarene healed him.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Cœlius</span></p>

<p>Is he really healed?... As his next
neighbour, you must know the truth....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>I know that he is as healthy in the face
as the rose of Magdala and lily of Bethany
whom you see before you; but I do
not know if he was ever sick, not having
seen him before his recovery....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>I thought so.... Besides, I have
seen much more extraordinary magicians
in Thrace and Egypt.... But, to return
to this leper without leprosy, what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
happens behind that hedge and in the
house of your mysterious neighbour?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>The Nazarene has been his guest for the
past three days. This Simon, his sister,
his wife and, I believe, his brother-in-law
are common people, who live on the produce
of their olive-trees. They were
timorous, peaceable neighbours; but, since
the arrival of the Nazarene, everything
is in commotion. It is a perpetual coming
and going, a perpetual tumult. Their
orchard is filled incessantly with a multitude
of sick, of vagrants, of cripples, issuing
from all the rocks in Judæa to beseech
him whom, with loud cries, they call
the Saviour of the World, the Son of
David and King of the Jews. There are
sometimes so many of them that they overflow
into my garden. The hedge, as you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
see, has been trampled, crushed and even
torn in certain places. Fortunately, the
Nazarene’s appearances are few and brief.
Besides, this picturesque spectacle, despite
its inconveniences, amuses and puzzles me.</p>

<div class="stage_dir">

</div>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Cœlius</span></p>

<p>Who are those people?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>What did I tell you?... Here are
half-a-dozen coming to ask for bread....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>Do they belong to this famous band?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>They are hateful and loathsome!...
One of them has his face gnawed with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
ulcer, another is almost naked, another is
starving!...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>They certainly lack shame, thus to flaunt
ugliness and dread....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>Do not be uneasy: these will not long
mar the pleasing grace of the porticoes
that refresh our eyes. My gardener has
discovered them; he is armed with a stout
hoe and is driving them back uncivilly....
You see, they do not insist, they
walk away in silence, hanging their heads....
And, now that we have occupied
ourselves long enough with these unfortunate
people, with their great leader and
their maladies, let us think a little of ourselves
and enjoy the delightful afternoon
which spring-time sets before us....
My pleasure at seeing you here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
would be flawless, if only our old friend
Longinus had yielded to Appius’ entreaties
and consented to accompany you....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>I never felt more keenly the vanity of
the great eloquence which he himself
taught me. To all my most convincing
and well-stated arguments he replied with
a sullen silence, or shook his head, repeating
that he did not wish to throw a gloom
over our happy party with his dismal presence....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Cœlius</span></p>

<p>And yet it is quite three weeks since that
child died.... I should not have
thought that grief could have affected him
so much....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>The more so as it concerned a child of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
tender years, whom her father knew less
well than did her nurse!...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>There is something more astonishing
yet, which clearly shows that the greatest
wisdom is not so much to know as to conform
to what one knows!... When,
more than fifteen years ago, I lost
a little boy who must have been of about
the same age as the child whom he now
mourns, Longinus undertook to console me.
He wrote me an eloquent letter, wherein,
relying on the authority of Metrodorus,
Panætius and Hermachus, he proved that
sorrow is not only useless, but ungrateful.
I found and read the letter again this
morning; and so striking are its more important
passages that I know them almost
by heart.... They were the loftiest
words that human wisdom could utter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
against death and sorrow.... They
protected me once....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>What were the words? It is well to
know anything that can relieve sorrow....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>“You expect consolation,” he said;
“you shall receive only reproaches. If
you bear the death of a child with so little
patience, what would you do if you had
lost a friend? You ought to bring yourself
to this frame of mind, that you were
more pleased at having had him than
grieved that you had him no longer. But
most men reckon past advantages and
pleasures as of no account. They bury
friendship with their friend....”</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>I recognize and hail the mighty wisdom
of our venerable master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>Why does he not remember it, when
misfortune strikes him? But why did I forget
it myself, when I needed it most?...
“I assure you,” he added, “that of those
whom we have loved, much remains to
us after death has removed them. The
time that is past is ours; and I see nothing
of which we are more certain than of
that which has been. The hope of the
future makes us ungrateful for the benefits
which we have received, as though the
favours which we expect were not bound
soon to be ranked among things past.
Death has deprived you of a son so young
that he could be of no promise to you yet;
it is only a little time lost. There are instances
without end of fathers losing infant
children without shedding a single
tear and returning to the senate after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
laying them in the grave. This is not
unreasonable; for, in the first place, it is
idle to give way to grief when grief can
serve no purpose. And then it is unjust
to complain of a misfortune that has befallen
one person and still threatens all the
others. Moreover, it is madness to complain,
when there is so little distance between
the one who is dead and the one who
mourns him. Consider that all mankind,
destined to one and the same end, is divided
only by little intervals, even when
they appear very great. He whom you think
lost has only gone before. Since we must
all travel the same road, is it not unworthy
of a wise man to weep for one who has set
out earlier than ourselves? To complain
that the friend or the child is dead is to
complain that he was ever born. We are
all linked to the same fate. He who has
come into the world must also leave it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
His stay may be longer, but the end is always
alike. The time that elapses between
the first day and the last is uncertain and
variable. If you consider the wretchedness
of life, it is long, even for a child; if
you regard the duration, it is short, even
for an old man.”</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>That would not have consoled me....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>To console, lady, is not to do away with
sorrow, but to teach one how to overcome
it.</p>

Simon’s house. They watch all his movements.
As soon as he is seen, they bring
the sick; and the fanatics come rushing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
up.... He must be walking in the
neighbouring orchard.... (<i>Listening.</i>)
Yes.... Do you hear the crowd humming
like bees?... It is close to my
laurel-hedge....</p>

<p>I do not advise you to. In the first
place, those people are mostly very poor,
extremely dirty and very unpleasant to
come into touch with.... Then, you
know the Jewish fanaticism.... In
these moments of exaltation, the most inoffensive
become dangerous; and the sight
of the Roman toga and arms enrages them
strangely.... Besides, we shall hear
what happens quite well from where we
stand.... Listen!... The cries
are coming nearer still and increasing....</p>

Man!... Lord, Lord, have

sick man!... Master! Master!
Lord!... Jesus of Nazareth,
have pity on me!... Make
way!... Silence, silence!...
He is going to speak!” At these
words, the tumult suddenly subsides.
An incomparable silence, in
which it seems as though the birds
and the leaves of the trees and the
very air that is breathed take part,
falls with all its supernatural
weight upon the countryside; and,
in this silence, which weighs upon
people on the terrace also, there
rises, absolute sovereign of space<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>

<p>You at last, my Verus!... For
three days I have awaited you, for three
days I have called you. Men grant me
my beauty when its triumph brings me nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
but regret and disgust. And I ask myself,
is that beauty really powerless when,
at last, there is a question of the happiness
which every woman has the right to expect
in her life?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>I know not if I shall be able to give
you the happiness that is your due, Magdalene;
but be assured that your beauty
never gained a more complete victory....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>What care I now for its victory!...
It is I who am vanquished, utterly vanquished
beforehand, without daring to confess
it to myself, without being able to hide
it from my indifference, so odiously acquired,
or from my vanity, which has never
been more than the shameful crown of my
shame!... But why keep me waiting
so long?... I thought that everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
was abandoning me, that all was lost because
of the dreadful words which I spoke
at our good Silanus’ and which were not
true, which were only a profounder lie
then my other lies, because I was mad,
because I did not know, because I did
not wish for an impossible happiness....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>You well know, Magdalene, that I never
believed you the woman you depicted....
But now neither do I dare believe
in the happiness that approaches....
I am quite dazzled, I doubt, I
grope in the dark.... I do not recognize
the voice that has so often and so
harshly repelled me.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span> (<i>in <span class="smcap">Verus’</span>
arms</i>)</p>

<p>It is not the same voice, it is not the
same soul....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>And yet it is really you whom I hold
in my arms, it is every parcel of you whom
I have implored so long!... I ask myself
still if all is indeed real, if all is indeed
possible, if you are not trifling with
a too-credulous happiness which you will
fling aside among all those which beauty
shatters when testing its power....
But no, when I question, when I follow
your eyes that plunge into mine, I see
that it is indeed true, that it was always
true....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>Yes, yes, it is true, it is true and it
was always true.... I did not
know it, I searched my heart in vain and
I was ignorant of all my feelings until these
days of anguish.... I refused to see
that you were coming towards me and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
that everything was awaiting you....
And yet I ought to have known it....
Already, at Antioch, do you remember,
Verus, how I avoided you?... I received
so many others; and you alone, the
comeliest, the purest, I tried to ignore, to
blot out, to destroy.... As soon as
you appeared, I withdrew, like a shy and
distrustful animal, to my lair; and, only
the other day, at our good Silanus’, I felt
all the evil, all the cruelty, or all the
despair that fills my heart rise to my lips....
But, to-day, I see; I am no longer the
same; I no longer know myself, because I
am myself once more.... All that used
to resist is broken within my soul.... I
no longer understand myself and I did not
know that happiness is so strange a thing....
I, who never wept in my worst moments
of distress, am sobbing to-day when
happiness awaits me.... I am glad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
and light-hearted and yet more shattered
than if all the misfortunes that hover in
the skies were about to burst over me....
(<i>Embracing him more passionately</i>)
Help me, my Verus, help me, support me,
you whom nothing threatens, you who
have nothing to fear!...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>But what has happened? Can any one
have dared, in my absence...?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>No, no, nobody; and it is not that; and
I myself do not know the danger that
surrounds me.... But I have no other
shelter than your arms; and I feel myself
lost if I lose you too.... Take me,
bear me away on that heart to which I am
listening, far from myself, far from this
place and from my anxiety.... You
alone can save me and I have no life but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
that which you give me.... But why
did you forsake me so long in my tears,
why did you not come until after the third
day, abandoning me thus, without a word
of pity, without a sign of hope?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>You are mistaken, Magdalene, or else
your slaves did not acquaint you with the
truth.... The very day after our meeting
at Silanus’, I came to Bethany to tell
you that, by order of the Procurator, I
was suddenly sent, at the head of a cohort,
to suppress a curious riot that had
broken out near Jericho. The slaves who
keep your door would not allow me to
approach you and replied to me in such
a way that I dared not well insist....
I understood that they were obeying orders
so precise and so stern that I must not try
to thwart them....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>It is true.... I forgot.... I was
mad and worn out, incapable of seeing,
willing or hearing.... I was not yet
awake.... It seemed to me that I was
still struggling amid the hideous crowd
in Simon’s garden, where I called in vain
upon him who had delivered me....
He was abandoning me, he too.... I
sent in search of him to no purpose. No
one could tell me where he was hiding....
Have you not seen him
since?... Do you not know where he
is?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Who?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>The Nazarene....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Let us not speak of that wretched man:
his hours are numbered....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>His hours are numbered?... What
do you mean?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>No matter: that does not interest us
now and soon we shall know nothing of
aught that does not touch our love; for
it is wonderful to see how the thoughts
of those who love each other meet and
unite in spite of the distance and of the
ill-natured speeches that come between
them. Is it not astonishing that, after
leaving you at Silanus’, where I had heard
words that should have deprived me of
all hope, I for the first time felt our young
happiness swell and blossom in all its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
strength and all its certainty?... While
you were calling me, I called you also with
all the deep and wonderful voices of my
heart. I was kept far from you by a duty
unworthy of a soldier; for that expedition
to Jericho, the last, I trust, upon which
I shall be sent, was almost odious and often
ridiculous. I counted with rage the minutes
stolen from our new life, which was already
beginning in a soul that feared none
of my reasons for fearing....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>It will not really begin until we are far
from this land where I suffocate, where
everything darkens and threatens happiness,
where I can no longer live....
Verus, I beseech you, if you love me as I
love you, let us hasten, let us leave everything;
there is no time to lose....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>You are right: a joy so long awaited
must not be born among these sinister
rocks, where floats an odour of death and
madness.... And yet, even here, our
thoughts came to an understanding long
before our words.... Like you, I have
resolved to leave this hated city, where
really my obedience is abused.... I
am at the orders of the Procurator, but
not at the venomous service of the Jewish
priests, nor of the clamorous and perfidious
nation whom my old legionaries have conquered.
I have had enough of this ambiguous
life. Before to-night, I shall find
a pretext for evading an order which I
was to execute this very day, an order of
which I but too well know the origin....
If the pretext appear insufficient, let Caiaphas
and Annas go and complain to Cæsar....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
Nothing counts in the presence
of our love; and the inglorious errand
which they claim the right to impose upon
me repels me all the more inasmuch as it
was to be accomplished, so to speak, before
your eyes....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>Before my eyes?... Of what are
you speaking?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Nothing that interests you; let us think
only of our happy escape....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>I know that some danger threatens
him....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Whom do you mean?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>It is impossible, after what he has done,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
that you should become the instrument of
his worst enemies.... You owe him
my life and perhaps our happiness....
What do they want with him? What orders
have you received?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>I am charged to arrest him before this
evening, together with the principal leaders
of his band. It is a vulgar constabulary
measure, directed against sick men and vagrants,
of a kind that has never yet been exacted
of the legionaries.... It shall not
take place; do not let us speak of it....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>But why arrest him? What has he
done? What is he accused of?... He
is innocent, I know; besides, one need but
see him to understand.... He brings
a happiness that was not known before;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
and all those who come near him are
happy, it seems, like children at their awaking....
I myself, who only caught a
glimpse of him among the olive-trees, felt
that gladness was rising in my soul like a
sort of light that overtook my thoughts....
He fixed his eyes for but a moment
on mine; and that will be enough for the
rest of my life.... I knew that he recognized
me without ever having seen me
and I knew that he wished to see me again....
He seemed to choose me gravely,
absolutely, for ever....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>What does this mean? Are you speaking
of him? What happened?...
Have you seen him again?... I was
told, for that matter, that he is an intriguer,
ready for everything; but I should
never have believed that he would have
dared....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>He has dared nothing.... I have
not seen him again, I shall never see him
again, now that we are about to leave
everything, to be only we two alone....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span> (<i>clasping her more closely</i>)</p>

<p>To be one alone, Magdalene, in a happier
land, where everything encourages
happiness, smiles upon lovers and blesses
beauty....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span> (<i>bursting into

<p>Come, I know these tears that well at

our one joy.... But here, between the
columns of the vestibule, come the greatest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
ornaments of that beautiful Rome which
we shall soon astonish with our love....
I am right: it is our good Silanus, accompanied
by the faithful Appius; led by the
immortal gods, they descend the marble
steps to hallow with their fraternal presence
the first smiles of a happiness born
under their eyes....</p>

Appius, the less should it trouble the perfect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>

that a phenomenon that will not be seen
again could not well shake the laws of the
universe nor the stability of the gods!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>I will tell you what has happened: he
has brought a dead man to life!...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>Who?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>The Nazarene, whose return I have
come to announce to you, as I promised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>He has come back? Since when?
Where is he?... Have you seen
him?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>To reply to your questions in order, lady,
I will tell you that he returned this morning,
that I saw him with my eyes and that,
at this moment, he is with my neighbour
Simon the Leper. I am surprised, however,
that the absolute frenzy which has
shaken the country for two or three hours
has not yet spread as far as here. It is
true that your dwelling is separated by a
high hill and some olive-woods from the
spot where the sepulchre lies hidden.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>I have heard nothing, learned nothing....
In spite of my orders, no one has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
told me.... But, after all, what has
happened?... Appius is as pale as a
ghost.... What is it? What has he
said, what has he done?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>He has done a thing which no man, no
god, has done before him; a thing which
I would not have believed if ten thousand
witnesses had come to swear it in the name
of the immortals, but in which I believe as
firmly as I am bound to believe in my own
existence, having seen it with my eyes, as
I see you now, and almost touched it with
my hands, as I touch this vase. He said,
“Rise, come forth and walk.” And the
dead man rose, came forth and began to
walk among us!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>It was apparently a dead man whose
health left nothing to be wished for?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>No, I am convinced that it was really a
dead man.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>It was a real, a terrible dead man!...
If not, my senses can no longer declare that
the sun shines in the blue or that human
flesh decays!... He had been four
days in the grave!...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>But who? How? Where?... And
the Nazarene?... I want to know....
Speak for him, Silanus: he has not yet
recovered his senses....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>Here, in a few words, is what happened.
Nevertheless, it is right that I should tell
you that I do not entirely share Appius’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
amazement. It should astonish us no
more to see a man return to life than to see
a child come to life or an old man leave
it. (<span class="smcap">Magdalene</span> <i>makes a movement of
impatience</i>.) But I understand your impatience.
I spoke to you the other day of
my neighbour Simon. He lives in the little
house that touches my property, with his
wife, his sister-in-law and his brother-in-law,
named Lazarus. This Lazarus, whom
I saw only two or three times, for he was
often away from home, had been ailing
for some weeks and died four days ago....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>Four days, do you understand?...
That is what nobody would dare deny....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>Nor does any one think of doing so, Appius.
They were a very united family;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
and the sorrow of those poor people was
great. From my terrace, I could hear the
lamentations of the women. According
to the custom of the Jews, Lazarus was
buried on the night that followed after
his death. They laid him in a new grave,
dug in the rocks that form the other side
of that hill, and closed the grave with
an enormous stone. This morning, suddenly,
the rumour spread that the Nazarene
had returned and that he was going
to restore to life the dead man, who was
his friend. Appius, who was at my
house, persuaded me to go down with
him; and we followed the crowd into the
valley of the tombs.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>I knew that he was to return to-day;
but why did you not send word to me at
once, as you promised?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>It seemed to me that the spectacle at
hand was not one of those on which the
eyes of a woman in the hour of her beauty
love to rest. Moreover, there was cause
to fear lest your arrival among the excited
crowd should cause a repetition of
the violence of the other day. For an
enormous crowd, silent, but quivering like
a swarm of bees, escorted the Nazarene, in
front of whom walked the two sisters of
Lazarus. We, Appius and I, climbed on
to a block of stone hidden behind some
bushes, whence we could see and hear
everything without arousing the suspicion
of the Jews. They showed the grave to
the Nazarene, who stopped and lowered
his head.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>He wept. They whispered in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
crowd, “Behold how he loved him!” But
nobody dared approach. They formed a
circle at a distance, as though round a
dread being....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>“Take ye away the stone,” said the
Nazarene; and two men stepped toward
the grave.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>You forget that, at that moment, one
of the sisters of the dead man, alarmed
and all in tears, seized the Nazarene by
the arm and said, “Lord, by this time
he stinketh; for he hath been dead four
days.” The Nazarene answered&mdash;I have
not forgotten a single one of his words&mdash;“Said
I not unto thee that, if thou
wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the
glory of God? Take ye away the stone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>Who is this sister of Lazarus? Is she
Simon’s wife?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>No, it is the other one: her name is
Mary and, when the Nazarene stays at
Bethany, she never leaves him.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>Is she young?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>She is younger than Simon’s wife.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>Have you seen her? Do you know
her?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>I have spoken to her more than once.
But to return to the stone, which was enormous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
flat and fastened into the walls of
the cave: two men attacked it with levers.
It resisted at first and then, suddenly, fell
down all of a piece....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>We were quite close, hanging aslant
over the cave. By all the gods who from
heaven rule the earth and men, I swear
that, at that moment, I felt the terrible
breath of the dead man strike me in the
face!...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>Did you see the dead man?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>As I see you now, lady!...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>I do not understand how you can seriously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
interest yourselves in these things
which happen in an incongruous, mad
world, where all is witchcraft, coarse illusions
and barbarous lies....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>By Hades and Persephone, what my
senses perceived was no illusion, I assure
you!... We nearly fell from our
rock!... The corpse was there, in the
greedy light that devoured the cave, lying
like a stiff and shapeless statue, closely
bound in grave-clothes, the face covered
with a napkin. The crowd, heaped up in
a semicircle, irresistibly attracted and repelled,
leaned forward, stretched its thousand
necks, without daring to approach.
The Nazarene stood alone, in front. He
raised his hand, spoke a few words which
I did not catch and then, addressing the
corpse in a voice whose pent-up force I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
shall never forget, he cried, “Lazarus,
come forth!”</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>Did he come forth?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>We heard only the sound of the wind
moving the garments of the multitude and
the buzzing of the flies that swarmed into
the grave. All eyes were so firmly fixed
upon the corpse that I saw, so to speak,
their motionless beams, as one sees the
sunbeams in a dark room.... Suddenly,
it became plain, terrifying, superhuman!
The dead man, obeying the order,
slowly bent in two; then, snapping
the bandages that fastened his legs, he
stood up erect, like a stone, all white, with
his arms bound and his head veiled. With
small, almost impossible steps, guided by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
the light, he came forth from the grave.
The affrighted crowd gradually fell back,
without being able to turn away its gaze.
“Loose him and let him go,” said the
Nazarene. And the two sisters of the
dead man, releasing themselves from the
human hedge, rushed to their brother.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>And he?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>He staggered, he stumbled at every
step....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>But the Nazarene?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>He went away without a word and withdrew
into Simon’s house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>And the dead man, how did he go?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>The two sisters, wild-eyed, mechanically,
blindly fumbled and cut the napkin
and the grave-clothes; then, supporting the
dead man and helping him to walk, they
led him away to the same house. The
crowd dared not follow them save with
their eyes. No one uttered a word; even
the two women did not yet speak to the
dead man.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>And the Nazarene? Has he been seen
again?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>He has not left Simon’s house. The
swaying multitude is waiting for him in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
the orchard and along the roads; for, after
the first long minutes of stupor, reaction
set in and a general alacrity followed....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>Which was as extraordinary as the miracle
itself! First, a confused and almost
dumb gladness, made up of whispers that
seek and feel for one another, passed
through the crowd. Then, as though the
truth had suddenly burst forth under the
skies, an unspeakable gaiety seized upon
the mass. The whispers became cries that
were not recognizable. The women, the
children and especially the older men exulted
frantically. It was as though they
were trampling on death, which a god had
just conquered and laid low, for the first
time since man came into existence. At
this moment, an inconceivable and dangerous
exaltation still prevails in all the region<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
round about the tombs; and, by Hercules,
though we have escaped unscathed,
I would not advise my worst enemy to risk
the Roman toga and arms there!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Is that all?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>What more would you have?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>I should like to know what all this
proves.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>It proves that this man who has conquered
death, which hitherto had conquered
the world, is greater than we and
our gods. It therefore behoves us to hear
what he has to tell us and to conform our
lives to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Silanus</span></p>

<p>I will conform mine to it, Appius, if
what he teaches is better than what I have
learned. By awaking a dead man, in the
depth of his grave, he shows us that he
possesses a power greater than that of our
masters, but not a greater wisdom. Let
us await everything with an even mind.
It is not difficult, even for a child, to discern
that which, in men’s words, augments
or decreases the love of virtue. If he
can convince me that I have acted wrong
until to-day, I will amend, for I seek only
the truth. But, if all the dead who people
these valleys were to rise from their
graves to bear witness, in his name, to a
truth less high than that which I know, I
would not believe them. Whether the
dead sleep or wake, I will not give them
a thought unless they teach me to make
a better use of my life....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>They are wrapped in a cloud of dust....

of them crowding toward the entrance....

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>They are following, at a distance, a
man clad in white, who is entering the
court....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>But what is the janitor of the first courtyard
doing?... Will he not stop
him?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Appius</span></p>

<p>Yes.... He is coming now....
What is he doing?... One would think
he was afraid!... He suddenly stops
and lets him pass without a word....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>And the others follow him.... They
are entering the second court.... The
impudence of those Jews is really incredible!...
In Rome, even during the
Saturnalia, we should not allow the crowd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>

You were at one.... And it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
was he whom you were awaiting with that
impatience which seemed so sweet to me?...
For who could be made to believe
that the fairest, richest and proudest
woman in all <a id="Judea"></a>Judæa would thus, without
a previous understanding, obey the first
word, the first sign of the grotesque and
repulsive messenger sent by one whom she
had seen but once in her life!... It is
too much.... I see, I know: go, since
you love him!...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>No, no!... I love you, but he....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>It is well, stand up.... I do not
keep you by force. But I could not have
believed that you had come to this....
I have fallen into one of your Jewish
traps. Do you see the crowd posted
there, under the portico, spying upon its
hostages?... I will not have Roman
property defiled.... I bear you no
grudge, Magdalene. Love, in me, is not
extinguished in a moment; and I possess
more constancy than woman.... I
shall watch over you. I know now that,
by destroying him, I can save her whom
he wished to destroy. He does not suspect
that he owes his life to me; for hitherto,
from pity or indifference, I had held
back the threats that were gathering over
his head. But, since he himself comes to
attack me in my happiness, I add to those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
threats all the weight of flouted love....
And, now, go with your guide from the
tombs.... We shall meet again before
long.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Martha</span></p>

<p>No, but James met her.... She is

was crying out, tearing her garments and
dashing her head against the walls in
Annas’ palace.... The servants drove
her away; and, since then, nobody knows

They will let us do as we please, I know
they will.... The Romans do not
want to judge him.... Appius told
me so, they are perplexed.... When
they took him to Caiaphas, there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
only two soldiers to guard him and two
sergeants from the Temple, armed with
sticks.... If only there had been five
or six men with me!... We would

would have been saved!... But I was
all alone!...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Joseph of Arimathæa</span></p>

<p>It is not so easy as you think, Magdalene....
All the populace was there, ready

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>But the populace is on his side and the

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Joseph of Arimathæa</span></p>

<p>It is different now.... They were

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>It was a few servants of the Pharisees
and Sadducees....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Joseph of Arimathæa</span></p>

<p>A few servants would not have been
enough to cover a public place to the very
roofs.... It was indeed the same
crowd as on the day of the triumph....
No, believe me, Magdalene, he knows
what he wishes.... He is determined
to be destroyed.... He has confessed
everything....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>What can he have confessed, when he
has done no wrong?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>Is it not the truth?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Joseph of Arimathæa</span></p>

<p>No doubt, but it would have been better
not to proclaim it to-night. In the eyes of
the priests and Romans, it is a crime punishable
by law....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">An Infirm Man</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Nicodemus</span></p>

<p>He foretold all this many times....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>That was because he knew the cowardice
of those who pretended to love
him!... Ah, men are great and heroic
and proud!... The only men who
have not fled, those who tremble least, the
best of you discuss and argue as though
they had to do with a measure of wheat;
and the women are silent and weep!...
Well, what do you say, my sisters?...
Is not this the moment to show your love?...
And those whom he has healed,
where are they, what are they doing?...
You there, who want to flee, blind Bartimæus,
the other one from Jericho, the
other from Siloam: those eyes, which he
has opened, you turn from me, because I
have the courage to speak to you of him!...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
You, Simon the Leper, you, the
other from Samaria, have you forgotten
that, before he came, you were more hideous
than death?... I see nothing
around me but miracles in hiding!...
The man whose hand was withered, the
man who was healed of a dropsy on the
Sabbath and the man of Gerasa possessed
by a devil, who dares not lift up his
head!... And, among the palsied,
he of Bethesda who is running to the door,
using his legs only to forsake the God
who healed him!... Even those
whom he raised from the dead are afraid!...
Why, look at Lazarus: he is more
pale than any of you!... And yet
you saw death, you; you lay touching it for
four long days.... Is it more terrible
than men thought?... You do not answer?...</p>

<p>Listen, Magdalene.... I lack neither
courage nor loyalty.... Notwithstanding
the power of the priests, I have
thrown open my house to those who followed
him. I know the price which I
shall have to pay.... I am prepared
to sacrifice everything and life itself to him.
But I know his will and I cannot disobey
him.... Peter wished to defend him
and drew his sword.... He made
him put it up into the sheath.... I
was at Gethsemane....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>Since you were there, why did you not

we love; we listen to them afterwards!...
But what will you do when you

too long with those who are afraid!...
What am I doing here, among men

you dare fight against a woman. I had

terror. You all shake your heads like
empty cornspikes; and the women rejoice
in at last discovering the cowardice of the
men, showing itself suddenly more signal

<p>Well, if he heard me, it would be as on
the day when that one among you whom
you all resemble reproached me with
anointing his feet with too costly an ointment!...
Have you forgotten what
he said?... Whom did he declare to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
be right?... You have understood
nothing!... For months and years,
you have lived in his light; and not one of
you has the least idea of what I saw because
I loved him, I who did not come until
the eleventh hour, I whom he drew from
lower than the lowest slave of the lowest

<p>Who are those extraordinary persons?...
I have never seen so many cripples,
vagrants and evil-smelling sick people gathered
together.... What do they want
with you?... I was told that you were
living in the midst of uncouth creatures,
the oldest, the ugliest, the dirtiest and the
most pestilential of those Jews whom you
mocked so pleasantly in the house of the
wise Silanus; but I could not have believed
that they were so intimate with you as
this.... However, that no longer concerns
me. But I told you that we should
meet again before long.... Appius informed
me that you had been looking for
me in the Roman quarter. I left everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
to hasten at your first summons. I
knew what was happening and I was biding
my time....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>How good and generous you are!...
How reassuring and comforting your presence
and your smile!... Those others
... if you only knew!... They were
trembling like the reeds of which our
Master speaks; and I was helpless and
dying with shame.... But I knew that
you would come back to us; and now this
is you, your arms, your breast.... It
seems to me that Rome in her entirety is
protecting us and that your arms, which
can do all things, cannot abandon him....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>They will not abandon you, Magdalene.
The rest depends upon yourself alone....
I am good and generous, perhaps, but in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
my own manner; and we must understand
each other.... So they have arrested
him in whom you take so lively an interest,
as I told you that they would?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>They have not only arrested him: all
the menials of the Temple, the grooms,
the herds, the meanest scullions in the
kitchens rushed at him, insulted, flouted
and ill-treated him.... And, as they
were afraid, as they were too cowardly to
venture it alone, they made the Roman
soldiers help them!...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>I know.... But had we not best
be brief and to the point?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>Yes, we have no time to lose....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Even so. It is not now a question of arrest
nor of more or less justifiable ill-usage,
but of imminent death. I have seen the
Procurator Pontius Pilate.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>Good. What did he say?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>I found him anxious, perplexed, at a
loss. He is a mild, irresolute man, an
enemy to quarrels and violence. He had
to choose between the inevitably bloody
revolt of the priests and their sectaries
and the sacrifice of an agitator who was
unquestionably troublesome and dangerous,
but who has not, perhaps, incurred the
death penalty in the eyes of Roman
law and justice. I spoke according to my
duty and conscience. He did not hesitate.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
He chose the more humane and
wiser course. And, as I am the armed
guardian responsible for the Roman peace,
he gave the fate of your Nazarene into
my hands. However, I must admit that,
before our interview, I had purposely allowed
events to take the course they
did....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>He is saved! I was sure of it! And
how right I was to fear nothing and to
hope all things in turning to you!...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Do not let us go too fast. There are
many things to consider....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>What do you say?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>I say that there are many things to consider....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
Had I known nothing whatever
of your adventure, my choice would
not have been in doubt: I should, while
more or less pitying him, have sacrificed
the wretched man to the public tranquillity;
it is the sovereign law of the empire;
but now....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>But now, it is different, you know him,
you know everything.... There is no
excuse for a moment’s hesitation; it would
be monstrous....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Indeed, there is no excuse for a moment’s
hesitation; it would be monstrous,
as you say.... Shall I, to snatch a
favoured rival from a well-merited death,
for the second time lose the only woman
whom I love or can love?... That
certainly is impossible....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>I do not quite understand....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Yet it is simple enough: in saving him,
I hand you over, without defence, to the
fellow who will drag you with him, by
fall after fall, to the bottom of none can
tell what pit of folly and wretchedness,
whence no human and reasoning power
will be able to extricate you. Moreover,
speaking for myself, I lose you irrevocably
by thus giving you, with my own simple,
foolish hands, to one who robs me of my
happiness by methods against which a
man who values the name does not try
to struggle. Whereas, if I abandon him
to his fate, there remains a chance of seeing
you return to the light and for me some
prospect of finding you in my path; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
our two lives have still, I hope, a long
space to cover; and many roads, as you
well know, lead to Rome....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>I understand.... I understand,
since I needs must understand....
But I do not yet believe.... No, it
is not possible; and you, the man whom I
know, have not come to tell me coldly that
you wish to destroy him and thus revenge
yourself for an injury which he has not
done you.... There is, there must
be, something else....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Yes, there is something else....
There remains to us, if you are absolutely
bent upon it, one means of saving him.
But, at the point to which we have come
and to which I have driven the adventure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
saving him probably means ruin to myself.
Besides, time presses. The sentence
is written, I have seen it. He will be put
to death at daybreak; for the hours are
numbered because of the Passover....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>What must I do?... Quick, quick,
I will do it....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>The prisoner is guarded by my men; it
is therefore not quite impossible to effect
his escape....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>Why yes, why yes, it is simple; and that,
of course, is what we must do!...
Once free, he will hide and he will be forgotten....
Let us lose no time....
But I do not understand why you came to
say....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>You will soon understand.... I answer
for the prisoner, therefore. Do you
know what I am doing, do you know what
I risk by restoring him to liberty?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>You are only doing your duty in freeing
an innocent man....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>It is not for me to enquire into his innocence;
that does not concern me. I am
not his judge, but his keeper....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>Your soldiers will hold their tongues
and no one will know that....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>My soldiers will not be able to hold
their tongues. They will have to choose
between silence and their lives. It will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
therefore be known that they acted only
on my orders. Now there is no instance
of the high-priests’ ever abandoning a
prey, a revenge, a hatred. They will go
and complain, first, at Antioch, to the Governor
of Syria, and, next, to Cæsar himself,
whose anger is kindled at the very breath
of a suspicion. Do you know what Cæsar
is? The greatest, the most powerful men
in Rome tremble before his shadow....
For me, it means, if not death, at least exile
far from Rome; and death, to us
Romans, seems sweet compared with exile....
That is what I give; that is
my stake; I am waiting for yours.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>You are waiting for mine?...
What would you have me give?... I
have nothing left.... I distributed
all to the poor the other evening....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>I do not ask for what one gives to the
poor.... And, besides, I have had
enough of those evasions which lead to
nothing and of those shuffling phrases....
Ah, much I care for justice and a vagrant
more or less in the world and my own fate
and my own exile!... Have you not
understood that it is you I want, you alone
and all of you; that I have wanted you
for years; and that this is my hour?...
It is not beautiful, I know, and it is not
as I dreamt it!... But it is all I
have; and a man takes what he can to
make his life!... We stand here
face to face, with our two madnesses,
which are more powerful than ourselves
and cannot recede; we must come to an
understanding!... The more you love
him, the more I love you, the more you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
wish to save him and the more I wish to
destroy him! We must come to an understanding!...
You want his life, I want
mine; and you shall have his life, but I
shall have you, before he escapes his
death.... Is it understood?... Are
we agreed?... Say no, if you dare, and
let his blood be upon her who has brought
him to this pass and who is destroying
him twice over!...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>Ah, so that was it!... Yes, yes, I
know, I see.... I was not conscious and
I no longer thought of it; but it was bound
to be.... Ah, so it was that which
caused me just now, while you were speaking,
to have no confidence despite my confidence!...
It is so strange, so monstrous,
so remote from us!... One
needs a little time to understand....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
All one’s thoughts become deranged and
one’s soul falls, falls, like a stone in a
well.... One grasps the meaning of
nothing.... One no longer knows
where one stands....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>You and I know quite well; and there
is nothing extraordinary in all this....
A few days ago, you would not have
needed so much urging; and I do not understand
that to-day, when the price of
love is something quite different, to-day,
when a life, dear to you among all lives....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>Ah, you do not understand!... And
to think that scarcely any one, not even
those who loved him, would understand
better!... Am I then the only being
that has seen into his soul?... And
yet it is not so very difficult!... He has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
spoken to me only three times in my life,
but I know what he thinks. I know all
that he wishes, I know all that he is as
completely as though I were within him,
or as though he were there, near me, fixing
upon my brow his glance in which the
angels come down from heaven, as on the
evening when I kissed his feet and wiped
them with my hair....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>I well knew that I came too late, but I
should never have believed that you had
gone so far.... If he has spoken to
you only three times, he has not wasted
the minutes and has told you enough to
remove my doubts.... But let us be
calm. It is a question other than of love;
and your lover himself, were he consulted,
would judge that a kiss does not weigh
much in the presence of death.... Since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
you love him so well, is his life not worth
a slight displeasure, which but lately would
not have inspired you with such horror?...
If there were a looking-glass in
this room, I would go and gaze at myself
with curiosity, to make out what, in a few
days, has made me so repulsive that the
torture of the one man whom you adore
is preferred to the touch of my lips!...
But what is the matter?...
One would think that I was speaking
of unimaginable things!... What
have I said? What have I done?...
Your face is distorted.... There
is no need to look at me like that, with
mad and terrified eyes, as though they beheld
the fall of the sun or the violation
of a tomb!...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>Let me be.... You cannot know....
I am only beginning to understand....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>A few days since, you were not so slow
in understanding....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span> (<i>in a soft and
distant voice</i>)</p>

<p>Yes, yes.... For one sees only little
by little.... (<i>Staring before her</i>) It
is unfolded slowly, like a thing that has
no beginning, no end, no name....
There are two deaths here, I hold two
deaths in my hand; and that is too heavy
a weight for a poor creature born upon
this earth....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Two deaths?... What do you mean?...
You do not intend to follow him,
surely?... Your death, since he loves
you, would only add a very useless bitterness
to his....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span> (<i>in the same
soft and distant voice</i>)</p>

<p>No.... I am not speaking of mine....
It is two other deaths.... I still
have my senses.... I can see clearly in
the abyss.... Let me look, where you
can see nothing....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>I should not have thought that, when I
came to bring you his safety and the great
sacrifice which I am making to love....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span> (<i>with a sudden
outburst</i>)</p>

<p>The sacrifice which you are making to
love!... Ah, if you could see the sacrifice
which is being accomplished here and
which the very angels dare not look upon!...
But you cannot know what has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
happened on earth since he descended
upon it!... It is no longer the same
earth; and it is no longer possible!...
Before he came, the purest would not have
hesitated!... Before he came! Before
he came!... And, even then, to-day,
I, who have been born again through him,
if it were not he, if it were a question of
another, I should not have the strength!...
I should perhaps sin against all
that he loves, to save what I love!...
But he gives too much strength to love and
to suffer!... I could save him in spite
of himself; but no longer in spite of
myself!... If I bought his life at
the price which you offer, all that he
wished, all that he loved would be dead!...
I cannot plunge the flame into the
mire to save the lamp! I cannot give
him the only death that could touch him!...
But look at me with clearer eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
and you shall perhaps see all that I perceive
without being able to tell you!...
Were I to yield but for a moment under
the weight of love, all that he has said,
all that he has done, all that he has given
would sink back into the darkness, the
earth would be more deserted than if he
had not been born and heaven would be
closed to mankind for ever!... I
should be destroying him altogether, destroying
more than himself, to gain for
him days which would destroy everything....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>It is not so much a question of gaining
days for him as of sparing him tortures,
the mere thought of which should make
you reflect....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>I know! I know!... Because I love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
him thus, as none has ever loved upon this
earth where heaven had not yet poured
forth its love, must I not sacrifice to him
what no human soul has possessed before
me?... But you come to ask for all
that he has given; and what he has given
is much more than his life and lives more
in our hearts than it lives in himself!...
If I destroy him in myself, I destroy him
in us!... I know no more, I see no
more, I understand no more.... I
would do it, perhaps, if my soul were
alone; but it is no longer possible and God
would not have it!...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>The gods always will what men will....
Be sure that, if he whom you are about to
deliver to the torture could make his voice
heard at this moment, he would not hesitate....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>Ah, I know that he would not hesitate!
And that is why I am struggling thus, like
a blind beast, between two sacrifices!...
It is my past shame that overwhelms me
and prevents me from rising to the level
of his will!...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Man has but one will in the presence of
death....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>My God! My God!... I am nothing,
I am defiled with every defilement:
what matters this one, which brings thee
life?... But am I in question?...
Is it not thou alone whom I defile to-day in
defiling thy salvation, thou, the very source
whence the source of all purity and of
every happiness and of every life will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
spring?... I no longer know where

<p>Hush, I beseech you!... Leave me
alone in his silence and his will.... Let
me contemplate, let me listen to other
things.... I do not yet love him as
he would be loved!... In vain I raise
my eyes to his heaven of light: I see only
his death, his sorrows, his suffering ...
his steadfast face, his eyes that lit up all he
looked upon, his mouth that spoke unceasingly
of happiness ... his feet
which I have kissed, lifeless and icy cold!...
Verus, Verus, have pity!...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
I cannot bear it, I cannot bear it! I am
falling!... Do with me what you
will!...</p>

<p>Magdalene, Magdalene!... I

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span> (<i>springing back
at his touch</i>)</p>

<p>No, you did not know! And it is not
that!... There is something else!...
There is another outlet!... Verus,
Verus, come, you are not without feeling,
you are not a monster, you will understand
also.... It depends on you.... For
me it is impossible.... There is a wall
there defended by his angels.... I
cannot pass it.... I must not think of
it.... But you, you can do everything!...
To think that you hold there, in
that human hand of yours, the life of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
God of Gods descended upon earth!...
I know, I know, you do not believe it....
But you must at least believe in
his innocence; and you know that he has
done no evil.... He does not even
know what evil is, since he is all goodness....
He has done nothing but heal, console
and pray.... He has done nothing
but breathe over men’s souls and flood them
with happiness.... If only you knew
him, if he had spoken to you, were it but
once!... Because he is innocent and
because you are just, because you have
strength and because you are brave, you
cannot deliver him defenceless to the executioners....
It would not be Roman,
it would not even be manly....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Enough of this; and, as everything is
useless, let him be treated as you have decided....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
It is not I who am leading
him to the torture....</p>

<p class="speakerlong"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span> (<i>clinging to the
garments of <span class="smcap">Verus</span>, who takes
a step to the door</i>)</p>

<p>Verus! Verus!... I implore you!...
That is not all!... All is not
said!... It cannot be decided like this!...
But do not ask the one impossible
thing.... I will be your slave, I will
live at your feet, serve you on my knees
for the rest of my days; but give me his
life without destroying in my soul and
throughout the earth that which is the very
life of our new life!...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>Enough!... Besides, there is no
time. My patience in saving a rival whom
I hate is as ridiculous as your persistent attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
to save your lover by singing his
praises!... When you see him dead,
in less than three hours hence, do not weep
over him, lest your tears should be flung
back in your own face!... (<i>Perceiving
<span class="smcap">Joseph of Arimathæa</span>, who discreetly
opens the door, to the left, of the
Supper-room.</i>) Who goes there?...
Come in, come in, this is the very thing!...
We need witnesses. Where are
the mountebanks, the monsters, the lepers?
I want to tell them....</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mary Magdalene</span></p>

<p>What?...</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Verus</span></p>

<p>They shall know who has betrayed their
god!... We shall then see if you have
the heart to despatch him before their eyes
and how they will take the news!...
Repugnant though they be, I want to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>

the door and throws it open wide.</i>)</p>

<p>I know! I know!... I am not

voice</i>) Hi! Hi! The rest of you!...
Where are you?... Hasten this
way, you halt and lame, you club-feet, you

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
